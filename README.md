# Eat-da-Burger
This app uses node.js, mysql workbench, <a href="https://goku-eat-da-burger.herokuapp.com/" >Heroku live demo</a>

In this a database of burgers is stored. You can add bugers and a buger image will be displayed. You can eat the burgers which will move the burger to a devored list.

This was a hard but very good learning experience.
